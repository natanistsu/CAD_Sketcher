The film begins with a flashback to the 1988 Summer Olympics, where young Randy Daytona (Fogler) is competing in the ping-pong finals against Karl Wolfschtagg (Lennon), a ruthless East German player. Randy is cheered on by his father (Robert Patrick), a former ping-pong champion who has bet on his son's victory. However, Randy chokes under pressure and loses the match, causing his father to be killed by the Triads, who had wagered on Wolfschtagg.
  
19 years later, Randy is a washed-up entertainer who performs ping-pong tricks at a casino in Reno, Nevada. He is approached by FBI agent Ernie Rodriguez (Lopez), who offers him a chance to redeem himself by infiltrating a secret ping-pong tournament hosted by Feng (Walken), the same crime lord who ordered his father's death. Randy agrees and travels to China with Rodriguez, where he meets Maggie Wong (Q), a beautiful and skilled ping-pong player who agrees to train him at her father's dojo. There, he also meets Master Wong (Hong), Maggie's blind grandfather and a former ping-pong master who was once Feng's mentor.
  
Randy trains hard under Maggie and Master Wong's guidance and learns the art of ping-pong. He also develops feelings for Maggie, who reciprocates his attraction. Meanwhile, Rodriguez learns that Feng has kidnapped several world leaders and plans to use them as bargaining chips for his nefarious schemes. He also discovers that Feng has a personal interest in Randy, as he was the one who sponsored his Olympic match against Wolfschtagg.
  
Randy and Maggie are invited to Feng's palace, where they are greeted by his army of female bodyguards and his eccentric henchmen, including Freddy (Crews), a muscular African-American man who speaks with a British accent, and Mahogany (Aisha Tyler), a tall and seductive woman who wields a whip. Randy also reunites with Wolfschtagg, who is now Feng's second-in-command and still harbors a grudge against him. Randy learns that the tournament is a death match, where the losers are killed by various traps. He manages to survive the first round, but is shocked to see that one of his opponents is Master Wong, who has been captured by Feng and forced to compete.
  
Randy faces Master Wong in the second round and tries to forfeit, but Master Wong insists that he must play his best. Randy reluctantly defeats him, but spares his life by throwing him into a net instead of a pit of spikes. Feng is enraged by Randy's mercy and orders his men to kill him, but Maggie intervenes and reveals that she is also an FBI agent who has been undercover for years. She frees Master Wong and the other prisoners, while Randy fights off Feng's guards. Rodriguez arrives with backup and joins the fray, while Feng escapes to his private jet with Wolfschtagg.
  
Randy chases after Feng and boards his jet, where he challenges him to a final ping-pong duel. Feng accepts and reveals that he was once a ping-pong prodigy like Randy, but he became corrupted by power and greed. He also admits that he killed Randy's father because he refused to join his criminal empire. The two engage in a fierce battle, with Feng using various weapons and gadgets to gain an advantage. However, Randy manages to overcome Feng's tricks and defeats him with a powerful smash. Feng congratulates Randy for his victory and then activates a self-destruct mechanism on his jet, intending to take Randy with him. However, Randy escapes with the help of Rodriguez, who flies a helicopter alongside the jet. Randy jumps onto the helicopter and watches as Feng's jet explodes in mid-air.
  
The film ends with Randy returning to the United States as a hero. He reunites with Maggie and they kiss passionately. He also reconciles with his father's spirit, who appears as a vision and tells him that he is proud of him. Randy then performs at a charity event with Master Wong and Rodriguez, where he impresses the crowd with his ping-pong skills.
