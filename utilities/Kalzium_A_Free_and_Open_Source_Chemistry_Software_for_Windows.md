Kalzium is one of the most popular and comprehensive chemistry applications in the project, and it has been translated into more than 40 languages.
 
Kalzium can help you explore the Periodic Table of Elements in various ways. You can view the elements by different categories, such as blocks, groups, periods, states, or properties. You can also use the year simulator to see how the table evolved over time, or the temperature simulator to see how the elements change their states at different temperatures. You can also search for information about any element, such as its name, symbol, atomic number, mass, electron configuration, ionization energy, melting point, boiling point, density, and more.
 
But Kalzium is not just a periodic table viewer. It also offers many other useful features and tools for chemistry enthusiasts and students. For example, you can use Kalzium to:
 
- Visualize the spectral lines of each element
- Calculate the molecular weight of any compound
- Edit and view 3D models of molecules
- Solve stoichiometric problems with the equation solver
- Learn about chemical reactions and equilibrium constants
- Test your knowledge with quizzes and games
